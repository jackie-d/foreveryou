## Receive chat messages from any internet user

An user can signup to this portal and get its web address page, and it can receive messages from any other internet user without having a registration. It's possible to receive notification, via Push or other, when a new message is received.

## Usage

Connect to the website: https://foreveryou-27e01.web.app/
